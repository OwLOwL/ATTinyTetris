It has plenty of RAM and flash! (256B RAM and 4KB Flash)

Physical stuff:
ATTiny412 - 8 pins - 5 available for usage by external stuff (2 for screen, 2 for controller and 1 for audio)
128X64 I2C SSD1306 12864 LCD Screen Board
5 x Pushbuttons and resistors (I use two pins for controller ADC)
Piezo speaker, resistors and transistor for audio

Please contact me for details about the schematics - I will add that later here also.
